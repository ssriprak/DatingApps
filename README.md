README: Analysis of Dating App Reviews and Sentiment Classification

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing user reviews from three major dating apps: Hinge, Tinder, and Bumble. The objective was to uncover trends, classify user sentiments, and provide actionable insights to improve app performance and user satisfaction. A Tableau dashboard was also developed to visualize key metrics and findings.

Files in the Project
	1.	Dating App Reviews Cleaning - 1.ipynb
	•	Purpose: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
	•	Key Tasks:
	•	Imported the dataset containing 10,000+ user reviews.
	•	Handled missing data (20% of records) and removed duplicates for a clean dataset.
	•	Renamed columns and standardized formats to prepare the data for analysis.
	•	Performed initial exploratory analysis to identify data trends.
	2.	Running Models on Reviews.ipynb
	•	Purpose: Sentiment classification and visualization.
	•	Key Tasks:
	•	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze user ratings and review distributions.
	•	Built a machine learning model for sentiment classification with 75% accuracy, categorizing reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
	•	Developed visualizations such as bar charts and heatmaps to highlight rating trends and sentiment distributions.
	•	Created a Tableau dashboard for actionable insights.

Project Deliverables
	1.	Data Cleaning: Processed raw data to create a refined dataset, resolving missing values and ensuring accuracy.
	2.	Sentiment Analysis: Implemented a machine learning model to classify user sentiments, with an accuracy rate of 75%.
	3.	EDA & Insights: Identified that 60% of reviews rated apps 4+ stars, with Bumble achieving the highest average rating.
	4.	Tableau Dashboard: Built an interactive dashboard featuring 5+ KPIs such as average ratings, sentiment distributions, and app popularity, empowering stakeholders to improve services.

How to Use the Notebooks
	1.	Prerequisites:
	•	Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, warnings.
	•	Tableau for visualizing insights from the dataset.
	•	A dataset named DatingAppReviewsDataset.csv in the same directory as the notebooks.
	2.	Steps:
	•	Open and run Dating App Reviews Cleaning - 1.ipynb to preprocess and clean the dataset.
	•	Run Running Models on Reviews.ipynb to perform EDA, sentiment classification, and generate visualizations.
	•	Use the processed data to create or update the Tableau dashboard for interactive exploration.

Key Insights
	•	Trends: Bumble was the most positively reviewed app, with 35% of negative reviews across apps related to subscription costs and matching algorithms.
	•	Visualization: Tableau dashboard highlights user satisfaction trends and identifies areas for app improvements, contributing to a potential 15% boost in user satisfaction.
